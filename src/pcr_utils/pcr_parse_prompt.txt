You are analyzing an EMS dispatch document (rip-and-run) and need to extract specific information into a structured JSON format.

EXTRACTION RULES:

1. CAD/Incident Number:
   - Locate the incident number field (commonly labeled as "CAD", "Incident #", or similar)
   - Extract this value as the "cad" field

2. Dispatch Time:
   - Find the datetime under "Dispatch Time"
   - This maps to "notifiedByDispatch" in the output
   - Split into separate "date" (mm/dd/yyyy) and "time" (hh:mm:ss) fields

3. Unit Activity Table:
   - Find the table (typically at bottom of page) with columns: "Unit ID", "Date / Time", "Status", "Dispatcher"
   - Extract Date/Time values in format mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss
   - Split each into separate "date" and "time" fields
   - Ignore "Unit ID" and "Dispatcher" columns

4. Status Mapping (map these STATUS values to JSON fields):
   - RESP → enRoute
   - ONLOC → onScene
   - TO HOSP → leftScene
   - AT HOSP → ptArrivedAtDestination
   - CLEAR → backInService

5. Multiple Occurrences:
   - If a status appears multiple times, use the FIRST occurrence

6. Missing Statuses:
   - If a status is not found in the table, omit that field from the JSON

7. Calculated Fields (only if not present in document):
   - arrivedAtPatient: Calculate as 2 minutes after onScene if not explicitly stated
   - destinationPatientTransferOfCare: Calculate as 5 minutes after ptArrivedAtDestination if not explicitly stated

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure (omit fields that are not found):

{
  "incidentTimes": {
    "cad": "string",
    "times": {
      "notifiedByDispatch": {
        "date": "mm/dd/yyyy",
        "time": "hh:mm:ss"
      },
      "enRoute": {
        "date": "mm/dd/yyyy",
        "time": "hh:mm:ss"
      },
      "onScene": {
        "date": "mm/dd/yyyy",
        "time": "hh:mm:ss"
      },
      "arrivedAtPatient": {
        "date": "mm/dd/yyyy",
        "time": "hh:mm:ss"
      },
      "leftScene": {
        "date": "mm/dd/yyyy",
        "time": "hh:mm:ss"
      },
      "ptArrivedAtDestination": {
        "date": "mm/dd/yyyy",
        "time": "hh:mm:ss"
      },
      "destinationPatientTransferOfCare": {
        "date": "mm/dd/yyyy",
        "time": "hh:mm:ss"
      },
      "backInService": {
        "date": "mm/dd/yyyy",
        "time": "hh:mm:ss"
      }
    }
  }
}

If the document is illegible or you cannot extract required information, return:
{
  "error": "description of the issue"
}
